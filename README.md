# CoderCheatSheet

CoderCheatSheet is a repository with list of essential programing definitions.

## Important note

All the definitions in this repository are mine interpretations based on provided resources (articles and books). You should treat this repo as its name says - a cheat sheet.
I highly encourage you to dive deeper into all these topics but whenever you will face a need to refresh your knowledge, for ex: before an interview, you should find this repo helpful.
If you find some of the definitions not-enough or incorrect, feel free to contact me or contribute.

## Main Goal

The main purpose of this repo is to provide a list of essential programming topics in the form of a cheat sheet which will allow a quick knowledge refresh in situations like upcoming interviews. 

## Updating

I will try to update this repo daily.
For me this will be Kata-like learning habit which may (i hope) become helpful to others.
